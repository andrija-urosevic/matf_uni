# Problem: Random Walk

Person is walking on line, starting from $x=0$. With probability $p$ person
stepes to the right $(+1)$, and with probability $1-p$ person steps to the 
left $(-1)$. This expermiment is repeted $k$ times. Find $EX$ for different
values of $k$, and plot $EX$ for different $p$.

# Code

```{r}
ps <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)
sum(ps)

EXps <- c(0.0)
print(typeof(EXps))
for (j in 1:length(ps)) {
    p <- ps[j]
    print(paste("p =", p))
    EXs <- c(0.0)
    for (k in 1:100) {
        Xs <- c(0.0)
        for (i in 1:k) {
            if (p > runif(1)) { # go right
                Xs[[i]] = 1
            } else { # go left
                Xs[[i]] = -1
            }
        }
        EXs[[k]] <- sum(Xs) / length(Xs)
    }
    print(EXs)
    EXps[[j]] <- sum(EXs) / length(Xs)
}

plot(EXps, ps, type="l")
```

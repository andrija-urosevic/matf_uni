    Abstract = {Attributing the culprit of a cyber-attack is widely considered one of the major technical and policy challenges of cyber-security. The lack of ground truth for an individual responsible for a given attack has limited previous studies. Here, we overcome this limitation by leveraging DEFCON capture-the-flag (CTF) exercise data where the actual ground-truth is known. In this work, we use various classification techniques to identify the culprit in a cyberattack and find that deceptive activities account for the majority of misclassified samples. We also explore several heuristics to alleviate some of the misclassification caused by deception.},

@article{ctf_ai,
    Abstract = {Penetration testing is a security exercise aimed at assessing the security of a system by simulating attacks against it. So far, penetration testing has been carried out mainly by trained human attackers and its success critically depended on the available expertise. Automating this practice constitutes a non-trivial problem, as the range of actions that a human expert may attempts against a system and the range of knowledge she relies on to take her decisions are hard to capture. In this paper, we focus our attention on simplified penetration testing problems expressed in the form of capture the flag hacking challenges, and we analyze how model-free reinforcement learning algorithms may help to solve them. In modeling these capture the flag competitions as reinforcement learning problems we highlight that a specific challenge that characterize penetration testing is the problem of discovering the structure of the problem at hand. We then show how this challenge may be eased by relyin},

    abstract = {As the amount of information, critical services, and interconnected computers and â€œthingsâ€ in the cyberspace is steadily increasing, the number, sophistication, and impact of cyberattacks are becoming more and more significant. In the last decades, governmental and non-governmental organisations have become aware of this problem. However, the existing cybersecurity workforce has not been sufficient for satisfying the increasing demand for qualified cybersecurity professionals, and the shortfall will increase in the next years. Meanwhile, to address the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals, academic institutions have been establishing cybersecurity programs, particularly, cybersecurity master programs. This paper aims at analysing which cybersecurity topics are covered by existing cybersecurity master programs of top universities and how these topics are distributed through courses. It starts by reviewing the evolution and maturation of the cybersecurity discipline, focusing on the ACM efforts, which include the early addition of the Information Assurance and Security Knowledge Areas to the computer science curricula and, more recently, the development of curricular recommendations to support the definition of post-secondary cybersecurity programs. These latest guidelines are used to analyse and review 21 cybersecurity master programs, focusing on the contents of their courses, structure, admission requirements, duration, requirements for completion, and evolution.}
